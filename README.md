A set of user preferences for hardening Firefox through a custom `user.js` file.
These preferences are *mostly* tested on my own machines, which as of this writing run Firefox 68.3.0esr (the Extended Support Release) and therefore don't necessarily support the latest version.
For example, these preferences may interact and conflict with [Extended Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop), a new feature available in Firefox 70.
